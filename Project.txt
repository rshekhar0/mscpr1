AIM:Diabetes Prediction System using Naive Bayes
Diabetes is a big health problem worldwide. 
We need systems to predict who is likely to get the disease. 
Helping with a project like this can make a difference in creating models using technology for healthcare.

Why would you like to choose project on Diabetes Prediction System using Naive Bayes

By creating a tool that predicts diabetes, 
I am helping to make medical technology better and could improve the health of people who are at risk for diabetes.
Naive Bayes is a helpful algorithm for guessing things like diabetes based on factors such as age, weight, and blood pressure. 
Naive Bayes is a simple algorithm based on two ideas: 
"naive" means it assumes factors are independent, like identifying a fruit by its color, shape, and taste; 
"Bayes" refers to Bayes Theorem for calculating probabilities based on prior knowledge and conditions.

why your project on Diabetes Prediction System using Naive Bayes (a website)is unique

Our website can predict the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. 
It is easy to use and gives personalized predictions based on health data. 
We use advanced technology to make accurate predictions and provide explanations and tips to help reduce the risk of diabetes. 
Users can also share their experiences and help with research on the website.

Future Scope
The Diabetes Prediction System aims to develop a computer program that can guess if someone has diabetes by analyzing their medical information. 
It will use a method called Naive Bayes to make predictions based on the person's details. 
The program will be taught using health data from a group of Pima Indians with diabetes and will focus on organizing the data, selecting important information, and showing the results clearly. 
The goal is to create a useful tool for doctors and scientists to identify and prevent diabetes by collecting data, preparing it for analysis, building a prediction model, testing its accuracy, and making it accessible as a web tool for users to check for diabetes.

Abstract
Diabetes Prediction System uses a computer program to figure out if someone might get diabetes early by looking at their health info, 
helping to prevent complications and keep people healthier.

Introduction
Diabetes is a serious health problem. 
A system called Diabetes Prediction System can predict the likelihood of someone getting diabetes based on their age, gender, weight, genetics, and blood sugar levels.
Naive Bayes is a method used by this system to make these predictions by assuming that factors are not related to each other, making probability calculations easier. 
Naive Bayes is commonly used for categorizing things and is effective in tasks like identifying text types, filtering spam emails, and assisting in medical diagnoses.

Our Diabetes Prediction System is a software that predicts if someone could get diabetes by using certain information. 
It helps doctors find people who might get diabetes early, so they can help them avoid or delay the disease. 
The system uses a method called Naïve Bayes to study patient data and make predictions.

Problem Statement
The project aims to create a system that can predict if someone might have diabetes early using a specific method called Naive Bayes. 
By analyzing health data, the system will identify individuals at risk for diabetes to improve early detection and management of the disease. 
This will be done by using a machine learning algorithm that can quickly and accurately process a large amount of data. 
The system will be trained and tested using a dataset from Pima Indians to develop an effective prediction model for diabetes.

The information we have includes details like age, blood pressure, weight, and glucose level, with one variable indicating if the patient has diabetes. 
We plan to clean the data, select key features, build models, and evaluate them to develop and assess our system. 
We will compare the effectiveness of Naive Bayes with other methods such as logistic regression and decision trees to predict diabetes and explore how Naive Bayes accomplishes this task.

Project Scope
The Diabetes Prediction System is a computer program that guesses if someone has diabetes using medical information. 
It uses Naive Bayes to calculate the chances based on details. 
The program is trained on data from Pima Indians with diabetes, and aims to help doctors and scientists detect and prevent diabetes by organizing data, selecting important details, evaluating its performance, and presenting results clearly. 
Data will be collected from a group of people, analyzed, key details chosen, prediction model created, accuracy tested, and made available online for users to check for diabetes risk.

The project will analyze diabetes data to predict if a person has diabetes.
1) Gather data about patients from a specific dataset.
2) Clean up the data by removing errors and organizing it in a better way.
3) Choose the most essential data for predicting diabetes.
4) Create a prediction model using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
5) Test the model's accuracy using different measures.
6) Make the model available as a web tool for users to check if they have diabetes.

Project Goals:
1. Create a tool that can predict diabetes using a special algorithm.
2. Make sure the predictions are accurate.
3. Make the prediction process faster and more efficient than current methods.
4. Use health data like age, BMI, and blood pressure while keeping patient info private and following rules.
5. Clean up the data by fixing mistakes and making it good for the computer to use.
6. Choose the right algorithm for predicting diabetes.
7. Teach the computer program using a training set to do the best job.
8. Make a simple interface for doctors to use the tool easily.
9. Check if the predictions are correct.

Modules and their Description
The system has one main module with sub-modules for users and admins:
- User: 
Register, 
login, 
predict if diabetic, 
view doctors, 
view diabetes information, 
ask for help

- Admin: 
Login, 
view users, 
manage doctors, 
add diabetes information, 
view help requests

Existing System
Current tests for diabetes are invasive, slow, and costly. 
They can lead to delayed treatment. 
Some prediction tools for diabetes are hard to understand and not very accurate.

Proposed System
There are two main roles in the system: Users and Admins.
• Users need to sign up first before using the system. 
Once their registration is approved by the admin, users can log in. 
The system predicts if a user is diabetic based on the values they provide. 
If they are diabetic, users can find nearby doctors and access information about diabetes types, as well as request help.

• Admins can log in using their credentials and manage user accounts. 
They can also manage doctors who specialize in diabetes by adding, updating, viewing, or deleting their information. 
Admins can provide information about different types of diabetes and respond to user help requests.
The system can predict diabetes using a Naive Bayes model, which is a type of math tool that guesses outcomes based on given information. 
It looks at different factors like past pregnancies, glucose levels, and others to predict if someone has diabetes or not. 
The system uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the visual part and MySQL for storing data. 
Django and Python are used for the back-end work.

Requirement Analysis
The project was created using Django Framework, which is a tool for building websites. We stored all the information in a database using MySQL Server.
